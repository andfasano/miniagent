# miniagent

This repo contains a number of utility scripts to setup a virtualized cluster using agent-based installer (ABI).
The main goal is to provid a quick and easy playground so that any user could be able to try out and experiment
the various features of ABI.

These scripts were synthesized thanks to the experience and contributions of the various authors of [dev-scripts](https://github.com/openshift-metal3/dev-scripts/)

# Limitations

The current scripts are limited to the SNO topology

# Pre-requisites

* Requires [libvirt](https://libvirt.org/compiling.html)
* [virt-manager](https://virt-manager.org/) is recommended
